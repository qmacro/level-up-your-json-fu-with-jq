# Level up your JSON fu with jq

A talk at [BTPcon 2023](https://www.btpcon.org).

The general [talk notes](talknotes.md) are available and have been written in a way to be consumed independently of the session itself. Data files for all the examples are available too. In addition, there's a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to build an image from which you can create a container with the tools you need to try out the examples.

There's a writeup of the conference here: [Double SAP BTP goodness in Isernhagen](https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2023/04/16/double-sap-btp-goodness-in-isernhagen/).
